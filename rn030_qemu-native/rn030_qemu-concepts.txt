	•	brew install qemu provides QEMU with HVF acceleration, leveraging macOS’s Hypervisor Framework.
	•	Community examples (e.g. FreeBSD 13.2 for ARM64) show QEMU supports FreeBSD well on Apple Silicon  ￼.
	•	You’ll need an ARM64 EFI (EDK-II) BIOS .fd file, obtainable via gist or Homebrew’s QEMU share directory.
