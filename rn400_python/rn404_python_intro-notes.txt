    If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
    create a virtual environment using 
    
    python3 -m venv path/to/venv
    Then use 
    
    path/to/venv/bin/python
     and 
    
    path/to/venv/bin/pip
    
    Make sure you have python3-full installed







python3 -m venv python-demo-venv1

source python-demo-venv1/bin/activate


# Install the Python3 venv package if not already installed
sudo apt install python3-venv

# Create a new virtual environment
python3 -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment
source myenv/bin/activate














To create a "Hello, World!" program using IronPython and compile it into an executable (.exe) that can be run on Windows, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install IronPython**:

   Download and install IronPython from its official website: http://ironpython.net/. Make sure to select the appropriate version for your operating system.

2. **Write the Python Code**:

   Create a file named `hello.py` and write the following Python code to display the "Hello, World!" message using a .NET MessageBox:

   ```python
   import clr
   clr.AddReference("System.Windows.Forms")
   
   from System.Windows.Forms import MessageBox
   
   MessageBox.Show("Hello, World!", "IronPython .NET Example")
   ```

3. **Compile to an Executable**:

   To compile the Python script into an executable, you can use a tool like `pyinstaller`:

   - Install `pyinstaller` if you haven't already:

     ```
     pip install pyinstaller
     ```

   - Navigate to the directory containing your `hello.py` script in the command prompt.

   - Run the following command to create an executable:

     ```
     pyinstaller --onefile hello.py
     ```

   This command will generate a `dist` directory containing the `hello.exe` executable.

4. **Run the Executable**:

   You can now navigate to the `dist` directory and run the `hello.exe` executable. This will display the "Hello, World!" message using the .NET MessageBox.

Keep in mind that IronPython might require additional dependencies to be bundled with the executable, especially if you're using .NET libraries. You might need to experiment with `pyinstaller` options to ensure that all required libraries are included.

Additionally, compiling to an executable might have some limitations, especially when dealing with dynamic languages like Python. Therefore, thoroughly testing the generated executable is recommended to ensure it works as expected.
