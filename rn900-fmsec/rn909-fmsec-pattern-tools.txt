# EveBox Installation Guide for Debian 12 on ARM64 (6.1.0-13-arm64)

## Prerequisites
- Debian 12 (Bookworm) system running on ARM64 architecture
- Root or sudo access
- Suricata installed and configured

## Installation Steps

1. Update your system:
   ```
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   sudo apt install wget -y
   ```

3. Download the latest EveBox ARM64 release:
   ```
   wget https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/releases/download/0.17.2/evebox-0.17.2-linux-arm64.tar.gz
   ```
   Note: Check the [EveBox releases page](https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/releases) for the latest version and update the URL accordingly.

4. Extract the archive:
   ```
   tar -xzvf evebox-0.17.2-linux-arm64.tar.gz
   ```

5. Move the EveBox binary to a suitable location:
   ```
   sudo mv evebox-0.17.2-linux-arm64/evebox /usr/local/bin/
   ```

6. Create a configuration file:
   ```
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/evebox
   sudo nano /etc/evebox/evebox.yaml
   ```

7. Add the following content to the configuration file:
   ```yaml
   data-directory: /var/lib/evebox
   input:
     - eve-file:
         filename: /var/log/suricata/eve.json
   ```
   Note: Adjust the paths if your Suricata log location is different.

8. Create the data directory:
   ```
   sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/evebox
   sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/lib/evebox
   ```

9. Create a systemd service file for EveBox:
   ```
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/evebox.service
   ```

10. Add the following content to the service file:
    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=EveBox
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/evebox -c /etc/evebox/evebox.yaml
    Restart=always
    User=www-data

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

11. Reload systemd, enable and start the EveBox service:
    ```
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable evebox
    sudo systemctl start evebox
    ```

## Accessing EveBox

Access the web interface by opening a browser and navigating to:
```
http://your_server_ip:5636
```

## Additional Notes
- Ensure Suricata is configured to output EVE JSON logs.
- You may need to adjust firewall settings to allow incoming connections on port 5636.
- For added security, consider setting up a reverse proxy with HTTPS.
- Monitor system performance, as ARM-based systems might have different performance characteristics compared to x86-64 systems.
